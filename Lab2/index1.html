        <h1>Here are some places to visit in Pavlodar</h1>
        <p>1. Pavlodar is located near the river Irtysh. In fact, it is the largest city near the river in Kazakhstan. In Pavlodar, you can find one of the most beautiful promenades in the country and this is definitely the place you have to visit. It is beautiful both in summer and in winter.

        </p>
        <p>2. The second place is called Batyr Mall. It is the most popular place of entertainment in the city. There you can find anything you want and need. It includes a variety of shops (clothes, accessories, beauty products, etc.), a cinema, food court, ice scating court, and a Wiking Park for children.

        <p>3. Another place that I would highly recommend you to visit is a cafe called "Crendel." It is a well-known bakery in the city that offers a huge variety of baked goods, coffee and other meaty plate too. It is located in the city center, which means that it is close to the promenade.
